<h2>Critique of Trader Joe's</h2>

			<li>I like the website. It has nice photos and icons. I do think it is a tiny messy though.</li>
			<li>I think the whole website is a little too much at once and is organized funny. If I was a customer I wouldn't know where to go to find what I wanted. I also think the side bar should have been put horizntal.</li>
			<li>Like I said before it is a little too much and can be confusing.</li>
			<li>Thegraphis/layout/multimedia definitely take away. At first it looked great and simple but then I realized it was too much when trying to navigate. It is just too much. I think there needs to be more blank space.</li>
			<li>The load time was very quick. I didn't have to wait at all.</li>
			<li>Like I said at first it seemed simple but then I realized it was too much. I think the background photo is what makes it so distracting. Maybe they should have made it more transparent.</li>
			<li>The navigation bar is okay. I have to go and click on the thinks and look at the page to understand what each one really was.</li>
			<li>The site has a color scheme but you would think it was a different one than it is for the whole website. The photo has a whole colo scheme that doesn't match the rest of the website. There is a vintage style through the whole website.</li>
			<li>The site works just fine with smaller screens. </li>			<li>I like that once you go through the website and look at the other pages it is easier to navigate and read. It is just the homepage that was too much. </li>
